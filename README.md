# Emprego-JÃ¡ (Jobs now)
#### https://carlosep-empregoja.herokuapp.com/
***A simple job-seeking website made with rails.***  
Emprego-Ja was the second project aiming to put on test several ruby-on-rails skills previously taught on Campus Code bootcamp.   
We initially worked on pairs, but after the bootcamp experience each one followed with it's own version of this project, implementing features as they see fit.   
In my version I used bootstrap to make it responsive, allowed authentication, so users can post their jobs, and view other jobs.   
This project is always active. As I learn new things, I implement them.

## Features
* **Blog Owner (or Admin) is the only one who can create, edit, or remove posts.**
* **Visitor can view individual jobs or an index with several of them.**
* **Authenticated users can post and edit their jobs.**
* **Authenticated users can create a company.**
* **Jobs on index can be filtered by category, company or contract type.**
* **Bootstrap added for responsiveness.**

## Future developments
* **User will be able to upload it's resume or create one on the website.**
* **User will be able to apply from jobs directly through the website.**
* **User will be able to view other user's resume and send a job proposal.**
* **User will have an user's area.**
* **Companies will be able to have logos.**
